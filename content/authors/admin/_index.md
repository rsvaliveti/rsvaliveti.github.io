        * Developed (white-box) requirements for various generations of Infinera ASICs in
              these areas: G.709 OTN tributary interfaces, FlexE, FlexO, Infinera Proprietary
              Signals/Formats (used on the line-side interfaces), Overhead processing, Alarm
              Propagation. Supported the ASIC development team through all stages of
              development to ensure full compliance to applicable standards.
        * Developed requirements for Layer 1 encryption (AES-GCM, AES-CTR modes) in INFN
              ASICs: at the ODU layer (in mapper ASIC) & bulk encryption (DSP ASIC). These
              requirements addressed the following aspects: algorithmic compliance, support
              for minimizing the cryptographic boundary (for FIPS 140-2 validation).
        * Specified the architecture for supporting protection switching schemes (e.g.,
              1+1 SNCP, Y-cable) in Infinera transponders and muxponders. This involved the
              timely reporting of defects to the protection FSMs, FPGA assist to minimize the
              switching time.
        * Developed requirements for FEC Support for OC3/1GE Optical Supervisory Channels
        * Developed the End-2-End mechanism for Shared Mesh Protection (SMP) for ODU
              connections. This mechanism has been presented in various contributions to
              ITU-T SG15 Q9 (OTN Equipment). This work contributed to the ITU-T
              recommendation G.783.3.
        * Defined the mechanism to support hitless ODUFlex resizing (specific to DTN-X
              networks). Working with ASIC & Software teams to get the mechanism implemented.
        * Developed requirements related to control channel realization (e.g. trib & line
              side GCC channels) for several generations of Infinera Network Elements.
        * Developed DTN-X Network Architecture Specification. This specification takes a
              top-down view of DTN-X networks, and contains an in-depth coverage of these
              aspects: Layers (i.e. Signals, Formats), Adaptations, OTN atomic function
              realization, and Defect propagation. This document is used as the basis to
              derive requirements for the ASICs/FPGAs.
        * Developed DTN Network Element requirements for these areas: GMPLS, L1VPN,
              Datapath recovery (protection, and restoration).

## About Me

I am a system architect in the hardware architecture group at Infinera Corp. In
this role, I have been responsible for the OTN features (e.g. client mappings,
ODU multiplexing, protection switching) in several INFN product families
(e.g. DTN, DTN-X, XT, GX). This activity involves examining the end-to-end
services in a top-down fashion, starting at the network level, and then using
this high-level view to derive requirements for (a) the Network Element as a
whole, and (b) the datapath ASICs/FPGAs that implement these features. In
deriving these requirements, I have used the standards/recommendations
developed by ITU-T/IEEE as guidance, and then expanded on these to generate
detailed guidance for ASIC/FPGA designers. As part of this activity, I have
tracked & contributed to ITU-T SG15 Q11 activities related to OTN
Signals/Formats/Equipment.

I have developed requirements to support Layer 1 encryption services in all the
INFN datapath ASICs, and DSPs. This activity too, involved a top-down
examination of the end-to-end view of encrypted services (e.g. datapath AES
encryption, overheads, key exchange, key switches etc.), and then determining
the functions/aspects which will be implemented by the ASICs.

I have had extensive experience with the development of SONET networks and
network elements, as well as Packet Optical Network elements that support both
TDM, and packet services. I started my career developing software for various
protocol stacks (e.g. X.21, X.75, HDLC/BiSync, OSI Layers 2-5), and then
gradually migrated to roles that define architecture for products/components. 

My graduate work was in the area of adaptive data structures. This work, builds
on the concepts from Learning Automata, and examines the effectiveness of
heuristics (e.g. Move-to-Front, Transpose) which organize data structures with
each access, so as to (hopefully) optimize future accesses.
