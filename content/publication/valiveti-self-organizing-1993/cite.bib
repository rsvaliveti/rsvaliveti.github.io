 abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of maintaining a
doubly-linked list (DLL) in approximately optimal order,
with respect to the mean search time. We study two types of
DLL reorganization strategies. Move-To-End (MTE) [12]
and SWAP [14] are two memoryless DLL heuristics
obtained from natural extensions of the well-known
singly-linked-list (SLL) heuristics, move-to-front and
transposition, respectively. We first derive a general
sufficient condition which permits comparison of any two
DLL heuristics. We use this condition as a guideline to
identify families of access distributions for which SWAP
yields a lower expected cost than the MTE. We have also
presented an absorbing DLL heuristic. The strategy
requires one additional memory location and is analogous to
the scheme presented in [15]. The reorganization is
achieved by moving each element exactly once to its final
position in the reorganized list. The scheme is
stochastically absorbing and it is shown to be optimal for
a restricted family of distributions. Thus, for these
distributions, the probability of the scheme converging to
the optimal list order can be made as close to unity as
desired.},
