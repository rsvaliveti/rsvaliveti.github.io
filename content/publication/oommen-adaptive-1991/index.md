abstract: The authors consider the problem of assigning more than one symbol of a
  finite alphabet A to the same key on a keyboard. Since multiple symbols of the alphabet
  A reside on the same key, the representations of all the words in a finite dictionary
  H need not be unique. The problem is one of optimally assigning the symbols of the
  alphabet to the keys of a given keyboard with a view to minimize the total number
  of words that have ambiguous representation. The problem is proven to be NP-hard.
  After presenting the only reported solution to the problem, a fast learning-automaton-based
  solution to this problem is reported. Experimental results demonstrating the power
  of this solution are presented.textlesstextgreater
