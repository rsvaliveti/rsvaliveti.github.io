 abstract = {The authors consider the problem of assigning more than
one symbol of a finite alphabet A to the same key on a
keyboard. Since multiple symbols of the alphabet A reside
on the same key, the representations of all the words in a
finite dictionary H need not be unique. The problem is one
of optimally assigning the symbols of the alphabet to the
keys of a given keyboard with a view to minimize the total
number of words that have ambiguous representation. The
problem is proven to be NP-hard. After presenting the
only reported solution to the problem, a fast
learning-automaton-based solution to this problem is
reported. Experimental results demonstrating the power of
this solution are presented.\textless\textgreater},
