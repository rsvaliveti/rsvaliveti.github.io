 abstract = {The problem of reorganizing a linear list, when the
individual records are accessed independently, has been
well studied. In this paper, self-organizing linear list
heuristics are examined under a more general query system
which allows accesses to any subset of the list of
elements. We propose a pragmatic model for the query
generator, characterized by a set of parameters of size
equal to the number of elements in the list. We derive the
distribution of accesses to the individual records of the
list, and show that these accesses are statistically
dependent. Throughout this paper, the set accesses are
processed by serializing the set elements.},
