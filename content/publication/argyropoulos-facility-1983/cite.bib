 abstract = {Accurate measurement and control for low-level transducer
signals in metallurgical industry or laboratory is a
complicated process. Until now, no measurement and control
system was working truly at optimum cost and performance
for a relatively small number of channels. A facility for
remote and local data acquisition and process control
applications in harsh metallurgical environments is
presented in this paper. The system consists of a satellite
microperipheral for interfacing between the “real
world” and a host microcomputer. The satellite can
operate far away from the host. Software and hardware
aspects of this facility are presented. Metallurgical
applications in four research projects ranging from
laboratory tests to plant-scale tests are discussed.},
