 abstract = {A fundamental problem in information theory and pattern
recognition involves computing and estimating the
probability density function associated with a set of
random variables. In estimating this density function, one
can either assume that the form of the density function is
known, and that we are merely estimating parameters that
characterize the distribution or that no information about
the density function is available. This problem has been
extensively studied if the random variables are
independent. If the random variables are dependent and are
of the discrete sort, the problem of capturing this
dependence between variables has been studied in Chow and
Liu (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory14, 462–467 (May 1968)).
The analogous problem for normally distributed continuous
random variables has been tackled in Chow et al. (Comput.
Biomed. Res.12, 589–613 (1979)). In both these instances,
the determination of the best dependence tree hinges on the
well-known Expected Mutual Information Measure (EMIM)
Metric. Recently Valiveti and Oommen studied the
suitability of the chi-squared based metric in-lieu of the
EMIM metric, for the discrete variable case (Pattern
Recognition25, 1389–1400 (1992)). In this paper, we
generalize the latter result and study the use of the
chi-squared metric for determining dependence trees for
normally distributed random vectors. We show that for such
vectors, the chi-squared metric yields the optimal tree and
that it is identical to the one obtained using the EMIM
metric. The computation of the maximum likelihood estimate
of the dependence tree is also discussed.},
