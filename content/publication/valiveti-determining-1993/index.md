abstract: A fundamental problem in information theory and pattern recognition involves
  computing and estimating the probability density function associated with a set
  of random variables. In estimating this density function, one can either assume
  that the form of the density function is known, and that we are merely estimating
  parameters that characterize the distribution or that no information about the density
  function is available. This problem has been extensively studied if the random variables
  are independent. If the random variables are dependent and are of the discrete sort,
  the problem of capturing this dependence between variables has been studied in Chow
  and Liu (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory14, 462–467 (May 1968)). The analogous problem for
  normally distributed continuous random variables has been tackled in Chow et al.
  (Comput. Biomed. Res.12, 589–613 (1979)). In both these instances, the determination
  of the best dependence tree hinges on the well-known Expected Mutual Information
  Measure (EMIM) Metric. Recently Valiveti and Oommen studied the suitability of the
  chi-squared based metric in-lieu of the EMIM metric, for the discrete variable case
  (Pattern Recognition25, 1389–1400 (1992)). In this paper, we generalize the latter
  result and study the use of the chi-squared metric for determining dependence trees
  for normally distributed random vectors. We show that for such vectors, the chi-squared
  metric yields the optimal tree and that it is identical to the one obtained using
  the EMIM metric. The computation of the maximum likelihood estimate of the dependence
  tree is also discussed.
