abstract: A method includes receiving client data; extracting overhead data from the
  client data; mapping the client data into one or more frames, where each of the
  one or more frames has a frame payload section and a frame overhead section, where
  the client data is mapped into the one or more frames; inserting the overhead data
  into the frame overhead section of the one or more frames; transporting the one
  or more frames across a network by generating a plurality of optical subcarriers
  carrying the one or more frames; extracting the overhead data from the frame overhead
  section of the one or more frames; recovering the client data from the one or more
  frames; inserting the extracted overhead data into the recovered client data to
  create modified client data; and outputting the modified client data.
