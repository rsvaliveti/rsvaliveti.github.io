 abstract = {A method includes receiving client data; extracting
overhead data from the client data; mapping the client data
into one or more frames, where each of the one or more
frames has a frame payload section and a frame overhead
section, where the client data is mapped into the one or
more frames; inserting the overhead data into the frame
overhead section of the one or more frames; transporting
the one or more frames across a network by generating a
plurality of optical subcarriers carrying the one or more
frames; extracting the overhead data from the frame
overhead section of the one or more frames; recovering the
client data from the one or more frames; inserting the
extracted overhead data into the recovered client data to
create modified client data; and outputting the modified
client data.},
