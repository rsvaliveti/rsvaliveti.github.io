- company: Infinera Corp
  location: Sunnyvale, USA
  position: System Architect (Distinguished Engineer)
  website: https://www.infinera.com
  startDate: 2006-10-30
  highlights:
  - 'Developed (white-box) requirements for various generations of Infinera ASICs
    in these areas: G.709 OTN tributary interfaces, FlexE, FlexO, Infinera Proprietary
    Signals/Formats (used on the line-side interfaces), Overhead processing, Alarm
    Propagation. Supported the ASIC development team through all stages of development
    to ensure full compliance to applicable standards.'
  - 'Developed requirements for Layer 1 encryption (AES-GCM, AES-CTR modes) in INFN
    ASICs: at the ODU layer (in mapper ASIC) & bulk encryption (DSP ASIC). These requirements
    addressed the following aspects: algorithmic compliance, support for minimizing
    the cryptographic boundary (for FIPS 140-2 validation).'
  - 'Specified the architecture for supporting protection switching schemes (e.g., 1+1 SNCP, Y-cable)
    in Infinera transponders and muxponders. This involved the timely reporting of defects to the
    protection FSMs, FPGA assist to minimize the switching time.'
  - 'Developed requirements for FEC Support for OC3/1GE Optical Supervisory Channels' 
  - 'Developed the End-2-End mechanism for Shared Mesh Protection (SMP) for ODU connections.
    This mechanism has been presented in various contributions to ITU-T SG15 Q9 (OTN
    Equipment). This work contributed to the ITU-T recommendation G.783.3.'
  - 'Defined the mechanism to support hitless ODUFlex resizing (specific to DTN-X networks).
     Working with ASIC & Software teams to get the mechanism implemented.'
  - 'Developed requirements related to control channel realization (e.g. trib & line
     side GCC channels) for several generations of Infinera Network Elements.'
  - 'Developed DTN-X Network Architecture Specification. This specification takes
    a top-down view of DTN-X networks, and contains an in-depth coverage of these
    aspects: Layers (i.e. Signals, Formats), Adaptations, OTN atomic function realization,
    and Defect propagation. This document is used as the basis to derive requirements
    for the ASICs/FPGAs.'
